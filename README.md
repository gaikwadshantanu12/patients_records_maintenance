# About Project
Our project offers a web-based app so that patient’s medical records are maintained online. This offers ease of access to doctors who could examine their past records, and based on their observations the new doctor may advice or add new check-ups or different medications.

In case of an emergency these records are used by doctors who access the app incase the patient is unable to access it (because of his/her physical injuries) and therefore proper treatment is given in those situations. This avoids operation failures or inappropriate treatment given to patient.

This not only helps doctors but even patients who can have trust over their doctor that right drugs have been selected from extensive formulary stored in hospital information systems.


# Why Patient’s Record Maintenance ?
Our main motive behind selection of this project was to allow doctors to access patient’s records through an online web-based portal. Most of the hospital information systems generate a unique identity document for new patients. This document ensures that every record of a patient in the future is recorded under the same ID for easy access.

However, the records of old patients that was maintained manually before the implementation of HIS remains unmapped in the system. When creating medical records for new patients in your hospital information system, remember to integrate the records of old patients accurately and comprehensively.

You can’t afford to lose records of your old patients, as these include complete details of their medical history, which can be useful in their future diagnosis. One of the popular hospital information systems.

A 71-year-old female in Pennsylvania was accidentally taking an antipsychotic for three months, instead of her anti-hypertensive medication. This led to ambulatory dysfunction, mood swings, tremors and many other physiological changes because of the medication error in manual prescription.

# Methodology
**a. Software we used :**  
We used eclipse IDE to do our java web application and XAMPP App as a web server container for tomcat and for MySQL database server.

**b. Frameworks / Libraries :**  
We used bootstrap 4 as a front end CSS – mobile first framework for building responsive web application. We used Java SQL Timestamp library for automatically saving date and time in database.

**c. Important Data Structure used :**   
We used ArrayList as our primary Data Structure. It is a combination of functions of arrays and linked list. It is a dynamic array working like linked list and providing feature of indexing.


# Installation
**Step 1 :**  
Navigate to the link https://github.com/gaikwadshantanu12/patients_records_maintenance.

**Step 2 :**  
Then click on ``Green Color`` Code button and click on ``HTTPS`` option. You will get the link below it like this - https://github.com/gaikwadshantanu12/patients_records_maintenance.git

**Step 3 :**   
Open the terminal/command prompt in your laptop/PC and paste the copied link along with ``clone`` keyword like this ``clone https://github.com/gaikwadshantanu12/patients_records_maintenance.git`` in the terminal/command prompt and hit enter. 

**Step 4 :**  
Now, you have downloaded the entire rerepository locally and you can access the code now and may start learning with it.   

**Step 5 :**   
Now, if you want you may import this project in Eclipse IDE and try to run it and work on it. And check its actual functionality.

# Working
1. As this app is developed from user point of view, the patient or end user need to add his/her record by himself/herself only.
2. With respect to text records, patient can also add the pdf file or scanned image file to web portal, for easy recognition of hospital name, doctor name, medicine prescription and details of disease.
3. It would provide and easy access for the user to go through the pre-records will less efforts as the user has to only carry their sign in details.
4. As walking with the present era the app provide paper less motto to save nature as well as provide a security assurance.
